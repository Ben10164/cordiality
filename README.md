# Codility

So this is intended to be created locally while solving the questions on Codility.

## Setup for Virtual Environemnt

* Have Python installed (optional: any Python manager such as `pyenv` or poetry, but this tutorial will just be for normal venv)
* Run the following in this directory

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

* Activate the environemnt

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

* Install deps

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* You are now ready!
* Make sure to set `.venv` as the interpreter in vscode or whatever IDE you use
* Lets test it to make sure

```sh
pytest
```
